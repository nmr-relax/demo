R2 relaxation curve-fitting analysis
====================================

The pre-calculated results in this directory were generated using the script UI by running:

$ relax relax_fit.py --tee relax_fit.log

Then the Grace graphs were converted to vector and bitmap images by typing the following in the terminal:

$ cd grace
$ ./grace2images.py EPS,SVG,JPG
