R2 relaxation curve-fitting analysis
====================================

This directory contains the 600MHz base data from the protein Ap4Aase required for curve-fitting R2 relaxation rates.


Pre-calculated results
----------------------

The "analysis/" directory contains the results of an analysis using the relax scripting interface.  This can be used for comparison.


Analysis
--------

The steps of the analysis to implement in the prompt, script, or GUI user interfaces are:

    - Load the sequence data from the 'Ap4Aase_new_3.pdb' structure file.  This consists of 'N' and 'NE1' spins.
    - Load all of the '*.list' Sparky peak lists.  The 'ncyc' part of the file name corresponds to the number of cycles of the spin-echo pulses.  The time unit for ncyc=1 is 0.0176 seconds.
    - Define which spectra have been replicated (this should be obvious from the file names).
    - Determining the peak intensity errors - this will use the replicated spectra. 
    - Deselect the residues in the 'unresolved' file.
    - Set the relaxation curve-fitting model to 2 parameter exponential decay.
    - Calculate the R2.
