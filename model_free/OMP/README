OMP model-free analysis
=======================

This directory contains the 600 MHz and 800 MHz base R1, R2, and NOE data for the olfactory marker protein (OMP) from the supplementary information of:

    Gitti, R. K., Wright, N. T., Margolis, J. W., Varney, K. M., Weber, D. J., and Margolis, F. L. (2005). Backbone dynamics of the olfactory marker protein as studied by 15N NMR relaxation measurements. Biochemistry, 44(28), 9673-9679.

To mirror the original analysis, values of -160 ppm and 1.02 Angstrom should be used for the CSA and amide NH bond length respectively.



Pre-calculated results
----------------------

The "analysis/" directory contains the results of an analysis using the relax scripting interface.  This can be used for comparison.


Analysis
--------

The steps of the analysis to implement in the prompt, script, or GUI user interfaces are:

    - Load the '@N' and '@H' spins from the '1F35_H.pdb' file.
    - Read the 600 MHz and 800 MHz R1, R2, and NOE data from the 'rates.txt' file.
    - Define the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction, using a bond length of 1.02 Angstrom.
    - Define the CSA value to be -160 ppm.
    - Use the 'dauvergne_protocol' to perform a model-free analysis.
