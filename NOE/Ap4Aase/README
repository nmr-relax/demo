Steady-state NOE analysis
=========================

This directory contains the 600MHz base data from the protein Ap4Aase required for performing a steady-state NOE analysis.


Pre-calculated results
----------------------

The "analysis/" directory contains the results of an analysis using the relax scripting interface.  This can be used for comparison.


Analysis
--------

The steps of the analysis to implement in the prompt, script, or GUI user interfaces are:

    - Load the sequence data from the 'Ap4Aase.seq' file.
    - Create a 'NE1' spin system for the tryptophan 40 indole system.
    - Load the Sparky peak lists 'ref_ave.list' and 'sat_ave.list' and set them to be the reference and saturated spectra respectively.
    - Set the baseplane RMSD errors to 3200 and 2600 for the reference and saturated spectra respectively.
    - Set the baseplane RMSD errors for residue 114 to 15000 and 2400 for the reference and saturated spectra respectively (this peak is close to the water signal).
    - Deselect the residues in the 'unresolved' file.
    - Calculate the NOE.
